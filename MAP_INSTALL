To provide map projections support your first need to make sure the libproj4
library is installed.  The source code for this can be found at:

http://members.verizon.net/~vze2hc4d/proj4/lbp4_050319S.tar.gz

The "--with-libproj4=DIR" switch in configure can be used give the location
of this library.


The following additional PRO files must be acquired and placed in the
appropriate directories:

map_continents.pro
map_grid.pro
map_horizon.pro
map_image.pro
map_patch.pro
map_point_valid.pro
map_proj_image.pro
map_proj_info.pro
map_proj_init_commonblock.pro
map_proj_init_common.pro
map_proj_init.pro
map_set.pro
map_struct_append.pro

These files can be found by entering the following URL into your web
browser:

http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/idllibsrch?keyword=map_

clicking on the appropriate file and saving it to your computer.

They can be placed in any directory within you GDL path.


To provide support for MAP_CONTINENTS the database files must be
downloaded:

blow.dat
blow.ndx
clow.dat
clow.ndx
plow.dat
plow.ndx
rlow.dat
rlow.ndx

These files can be found at:

http://comm.nsdl.org/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi/ddtoolkitnfndry/ETA_Viewer/Development/resource/maps/low/

These files should be placed in the "resource/maps/low" subdirectory
of the !DIR directory which can be found by starting GDL and printing
the !DIR system variable.

Note: Only low-resolution boundaries are currently supported.


The following projections are at least partially supported:

Stereographic Projection:  (1)
Orthographic Projection:   (2)
Lambert Conformal Conic:   (3)
Lambert Equal Area Conic:  (4)
Gnomonic:                  (5)
Azimuthal Equidistant:     (6)
Cylindrical Equidistant:   (8)
Mercator:                  (9)
Aitoff:                   (12)


NOTE: Map projection support in GDL is a work in progress.  There are
BUGS!!  These will be fixed as time permits.  Additional projections
will also be added in the same manner.  Bug reports and projection
requests are appreciated.
