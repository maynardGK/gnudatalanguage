Just collecting few useful scripts :

* The CVS side :

** init_gdl_CVS.sh : How to do the first checkout of the CVS of GDL
** update_gdl_CVS.sh : How to uptade the CVS

* The packages side

Which packages you need for a given distro, the mandatory ones
and some optional ones. This is convenient on a new machine
before running the first "cmake" to avoid install in N times
the various packages we need. These scripts are not perfect
(e.g. it is not that easy to manage non LSB systems,
it is not so easy to manage the virtual packages like xserver-xorg-dev
vs libx11-dev : both are OK) and we really welcome your feedback.

** which_packages_to_add.sh : if you don't really know if you
are using a APT or a RPM based system

** aptget4gdl.sh : for APT based systems 
(working well on recent Debian and Ubuntu)

** rpm4gdl.sh : for RPM based systems
(not that bad on CentOS)
