Writing GDL extensions in python
================================

Since version 0.7.1 GDL provides two additional subroutines:
A PYTHON function and a PYTHON procedure.

Both are very similar, the difference is, that any result
returned in the procedures is quietly ignored, while for
the function an exception is raised if python's None is
returned except the DEFAULTRETURN keyword is set to a value, in which
case that value is returned in case of 'None'.

the syntax is:

PYTHON,python_module[,python_function[,arg1,...,argN]],ARGV=argv

res = PYTHON(python_module[,python_function[,arg1,...,argN]],ARGV=argv,
             DEFAULTRETURN=defaultreturn)

python_module   the python module to load
python_function the python function to call. If this paramter is not
                specified, only the module is loaded and initialized.
                Note that the module intitialization is done only the
                first time a python module is loaded.

arg1,...,argN   arguments to be passed to the python function
                scalars and one dimensional arrays are passed 
                as python scalars, an array is passed as a python
                numarray.

Numarray is a popular extension to pyhton. Using it let python be
integrated in GDL quite seamlessly. See:
http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray
for details.

ARGV           set this keyword to a string or string array
               which is set to the command line options for python.
	       The first element is the (faked) name of the python
               executable. With this pythons search path for modules
               (sys.path) can be manipulated. If this keyword is set,
               no parameter (python_module) need to be specified.

DEFAULTRETURN  default return value, returned if the python function
               returns 'None'.

Note that for a GDL extension, you probably have to write a GDL
program file (.pro) containing a function/procedure which uses
the PYTHON function/procedure and a python module (.py) which gets
called by PYTHON within your subroutine.
For an as simple as it gets example see the files
gdl/py/python_print.py and gdl/pro/py_print.pro

If you have the python package 'matplotlib' installed
(see: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net), you can test the (little)
more elaborate example in. 
gdl/py/python_plot.py and gdl/pro/py_plot.pro
(Note that the matplotlib library has much more capabilities then used
here.)

For the version of python and its packages used please refer to the
README file.

If you have any suggestions or needs for extensions of the python
interface please see "CONTACT" in the README file.
