<p>As GDL is almost 100% compatible to IDL (although not complete as many
subroutines are waiting to be implemented), resources for IDL can also
be utilized for GDL.</p>
 
<p>
Many IDL resources can be found on the page run by IDL guru
<a href="http://www.dfanning.com/documents/idllinks.html"
target="_self">David Fanning</a>.
</p>
<p>
Lots of routines written for IDL can be found with the
<a href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/deutsch/idl/htmlhelp/"
target="_self">IDL Libraries Browser</a> many of them should also
work with GDL.
</p>
<p>
An IDL online tutorial is available at the Scientific Computing and
Visualization <a href="http://www.bu.edu/tech/research/training/tutorials/idl/"
target="_self">website</a>.
</p>
<p>
For writing programs in GDL using Emacs the Emacs addon (mode) 
<a href="http://www.idlwave.org/"target="_self">IDLWAVE</a>, maintained
by J.D. Smith is highly appreciated.
