<h2><a href="index.html">GDL Documentation</a></h2>
			
<p>
There's an ongoing effort to write the GDL User's and Developer's guide.
Currently the documentation covers an automatically-generated list of all available library routines 
and their keywords, about 100 code examples, and a few drafts of library 
routine descriptions and other chapters.
</p>

<p>
The documentation is available as a single PDF file (only in English):
<a href="http://gnudatalanguage.sf.net/gdl.pdf">http://gnudatalanguage.sf.net/gdl.pdf [PDF, 1.2 MiB]</a>
</p>

<p>
While GDL itself reached a beta status of development, the documentation
  is far from reaching an alpha status - help is very welcome!
Please report any inconsistencies in the documentation as any other
  bugs in GDL. Please submit new additions to the text (incl. code examples)
  as patches to GDL (see <a href="support.php">support &amp; feedback</a>).
</p>

<p>
As GDL is almost 100% compatible to IDL (although not complete as many subroutines 
  are waiting to be implemented), documentation and tutorials for IDL can also be 
  utilized for GDL (see <a href="resources.php">resources</a>).
