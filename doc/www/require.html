<p>Obligatory libraries:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://plplot.sourceforge.net/source/index.html" target="_self">plplot</a></li>      
    <li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl" target="_self">gsl</a></li>         
    <li><a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/readline/readline-4.3.tar.gz" target="_self">readline</a></li>
</ul>    

<p>Optional libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/www/download.html" target="_self">ImageMagick</a></li>   
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf" target="_blank">netCDF</a></li>   
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF/HDF_Current"
target="_self">HDF (version 4)</a></li>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF5/current" target="_self">HDF5</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.python.org" target="_self">python</a></li>   
<li><a
href="http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray"
target="_self">numarray</a> (obligatory with python)</li>
<li><a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net"
target="_self">matplotlib</a> (optional for python)</li>
<li><a href="http://cow.physics.wisc.edu/~craigm/idl/down/cmsvlib.tar.gz">CMSVLIB</a> (for SAVE and RESTORE)</li>
</ul>

<p>At least g++ 3.2 (or a similar C++ standard conforming
compiler) is needed for compiling GDL. 
Note that due to problems with static casts <b>g++ 3.3.1
does not compile GDL</b>, but 3.3.2 works fine again, so does 4.0 .
GDL compiles under Mac OS X (10.2, 10.3 and 10.4) with g++ 3.3 (build 1671 -
for build 1666 problems were reported) and with g++ 4.0.
</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/readline/readline-5.0.tar.gz"
target="_self">GNU readline</a>
library 4.3 or later is needed (GDL should compile
without it, but it's very inconvenient to use that way, furthermore,
proper event handling for graphic windows requires readline).<br/>
OS X 10.4: Note that the the readline library which comes with OS X is <b>
not</b> GNU readline. You need to install GNU readline and set the --with-readlinedir= DIR option to configure.
</p>

<p>GDL uses the <a href="http://plplot.sourceforge.net/source/index.html"
target="_self">plplot</a>
 library version 5.3 or later for graphics.<br/>
</p>

<p>Furthermore you need the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl" target="_self">GNU Scientific Library</a>.
</p>

<p>For reading and writing images in several formats, GDL uses
<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/www/download.html" target="_self">ImageMagick</a>.
It is required by default. If you don't want to use it, use 
'--with-Magick=no' as a command line option to 'configure'.
</p>

<p>The HDF format is supported (version 4).
If you want to use it, you need the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF/HDF_Current" target="_self">HDF library</a>.
It is required by default. If you don't want to use it, use 
'--with-hdf=no' as a command line option to 'configure'.
Note that HDF in turn needs other libraries. Check out the
<a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu" target="_self">HDF homepage</a> for
more information.
</p>

<p>Basic support for HDF5 is provided.
If you want to use it, you need the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF5/current" target="_self">HDF5 library</a>.
It is required by default. If you don't want to use it, use 
'--with-hdf5=no'. Note that HDF5 in turn needs other libraries. Check out the
<a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu" target="_self">HDF homepage</a> 
for more information.
</p>


<p>The netCDF format is fully supported since version 0.8 . If you
 want to use it, you need the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf" target="_blank">netCDF library</a>.
It is required by default. If you don't want to use it, use 
'--with-netcdf=no' as a command line option to 'configure'.
</p>

<p>GDL has an interface to <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_self">python</a> (GDL can be build and used as a python module as well).
As so far there are only two example GDL extensions written in python its use optional for now but required by default.
If you don't want to use it, use '--with-python=no'
as a command line option to 'configure'.
If you want to use it you need python 2.3 or later and the python package
<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray" target="_self">numarray</a> 0.9 (or later). 
For nice graphical output the python package <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net" target="_self">matplotlib</a> 0.52 (or later)
is used in one of the examples.
The GDL configure script will determine the installed python version
automatically. For this the python executable must be installed.
The python version can be explictely set with 
--enable-pyhton_version=VERSION# (eg. --enable-pyhton_version=2.3).
Note: For embedding python as done by GDL, the python dynamic
library is needed which is <b>not</b> build by default. You need to run
'configure' for python with the '--enable-shared' option. Please see
the python README file for details.
See the file PYTHON.txt in the GDL home directory for more details.

<p>GDL was developed using <a href="http://www.antlr.org"
target="_self">ANTLR</a> 
but unless you want to change the grammar (*.g files) you don't need
ANTLR. All relevant ANTLR files are included in the package.<br/>
</p>

<p>GDL is currently developed using <a href="http://www.kdevelop.org" target="_self">KDevelop</a> 3.3.6 under Fedora Core 7 GNU/Linux. The KDevelop project file is included in the tarball, so if you
have KDevelop you should be able to use it with GDL seamlessly.</p>
