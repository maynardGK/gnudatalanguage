                    GDL - GNU Data Language 
                    =======================

A free IDL (Interactive Data Language) compatible incremental compiler
(capable of running programs written in IDL/GDL).
IDL is a registered trademark of Research Systems Inc. 
(see: http://www.rsinc.com)


HOMEPAGE:
=========

http://gnudatalanguage.sourceforge.net


FEATURES:
=========

Full syntax compatibility with IDL 6.0

All IDL language elements are supported, including:

Pointer, Objects, Structs,
Arrays, System variables,
Common blocks, Assoc variables,
All operators, All datatypes,
_EXTRA, _STRICT_EXTRA and _REF_EXTRA keywords...

The file input output system is fully implemented
(Exception: For formatted I/O the C() sub-codes are not supported yet)

netCDF files are fully supported.
HDF4 files are supported.
Basic support for HDF5 files.

Overall more than 230 library routines are implemented.
For a list enter HELP,/LIB at the command prompt and look for
library routines written in GDL in the src/pro subdirectory.

Graphical output is partially implemented. The PLOT, OPLOT and TV
commands (along with WINDOW, WDELETE, SET_PLOT, WSET, TVLCT, LOADCT)
work (important keywords, some !P system variable tags and multi-plots
are supported) for X windows and postscript output.

GDL has an interface to python. See the file PYTHON.txt for details.

No GUI support (widgets) is implemented so far.


REQUIREMENTS:
=============

In short:
Obligatory libraries:
plplot      http://plplot.sourceforge.net/source/index.html
gsl         http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl
readline    http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/readline/readline-4.3.tar.gz

Optional libraries:
ImageMagick http://www.imagemagick.org/www/download.html
netCDF      ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-3.5.1.tar.Z
HDF4        ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF/HDF_Current
HDF5        ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF5/current
python      http://www.python.org
Only with python:
numarray    http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray
matplotlib  http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net


At least g++ 3.2 (or a similar C++ standard conforming
compiler) is needed for compiling GDL.
Note that due to problems with static casts g++ 3.3.1
does NOT compile GDL, but 3.3.2 and 3.4.1 work fine again.
GDL compiles under Mac OS X (10.2, 10.3) with g++ 3.3 . 

The GNU readline library 4.3 is needed (actually GDL should compile
without, but its very inconvenient to use that way, furthermore
proper event handling for graphic windows requires readline).
You can get it at:
http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/readline/readline-4.3.tar.gz

As GDL includes graphics support, the plplot library version 5.3
is necessary. To download plplot please look at:
http://plplot.sourceforge.net/source/index.html

Furthermore you need the GNU Scientific Library.
Joel Gales has start using it to implement GDL library routines.  
You find it at:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl

The HDF4 format is (not completely yet) supported (thanks to Joel
Gales). If you want to use it, you need the HDF library (her HDF
always means version 4).
Note that if you plan to use netCDF also, it might be necessary to
install HDF4 before netCDF due to same named but different header
files which are overwritten by the HDF4 version otherwise.
HDF4 is required by default. If you don't want to use it, use 
--with-hdf=no
Note that HDF in turn needs other libraries. Check out the
homepage for more information:
http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/
The HDF library can be downloaded from:
ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF/HDF_Current

Basic support for HDF5 is now provided (thanks to Peter Messmer).
If you want to use it, you need the HDF5 library.
It is required by default. If you don't want to use it, use 
--with-hdf5=no
Note that HDF5 in turn needs other libraries. Check out the
homepage for more information:
http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5
The HDF5 library can be downloaded from:
ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF5/current

The netCDF format is fully supported (thanks to Christopher Lee). If
you want to use netCDF, you need the netCDF library (even if HDF4 is
used, the netCDF library is needed, as the HDF library does not
contain all needed netCDF functions. Note that it might be necessary
to install netCDF after HDF4 due to same named, but different header
files.) 
netCDF is used by default. If you don't want to use it, use 
--with-netcdf=no
as a command line option to 'configure'.
netCDF is available from:
ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-3.5.1.tar.Z

In order to read and write images in several formats, GDL uses ImageMagick.
It is required by default. If you don't want to use it, use 
--with-Magick=no
ImageMagick can be obtained from:
http://www.imagemagick.org/www/download.html

GDL has an interface to python (see http://www.python.org). As so far
there are only two example GDL extensions written in python its use
is optional for now but required by default. If you don't want to use
it, use  
--with-python=no
as a command line option to 'configure'.
If you want to use it you need python 2.3 and the python package
'numarray' version 0.9 or later
(http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray).
Note: For embedding python as it is done by GDL, the python dynamic
library is needed which is *not* build by default. You need to run
'configure' for python with the '--enable-shared' option. Please see
the python README file for details.
For nice graphical output the python package matplotlib
(http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net) is used in one of the examples.
See the file PYTHON.txt for more details.

GDL 0.8.8 was developed using ANTLR 2.7.4,   
but unless you want to change the grammar (*.g files) you don't need
ANTLR. All relevant ANTLR files are included in the package.
For more information on ANTRL see: http://www.antlr.org

GDL is currently developed using KDevelop 3.1.0 under Mandrake Linux
10.0 and KDevelop 3.1.1 under Fedora Core 3. The KDevelop project file
is included in the tarball, so if you have KDevelop you should be able
to use it with GDL seamlessly.


INSTALLATION:
=============

Please see the INSTALL file for details.


CONTRIBUTIONS:
==============

GDL 0.8.8 is actively developed, but still in beta state as of
February 2005.
Even though it can already be used for several tasks, there are many
things to be done.
Bug reports, feedback in general and interested people who would
like to join this project are welcome.
Extensions to GDL can be made in C++, GDL or python.
 
Urgent things to do are:
Library functions and procedures,
Porting GDL to other platforms,
Completing the graphical output system,
Testing and test routines written in GDL,
Implementing GUI library functions.


HACKING:
========

please see file HACKING for details.
There you find also information about LINKIMAGE.
