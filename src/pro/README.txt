some informations about these files dans this directory

1/ procedures from the IDL library

Most of the files here are re-implementation of the
open source files avaiblable in the IDL lib directory.
Since this libreary is under Copyrigth, we cannot copy then in GDL.
Then we need to develop a clone for some of the most useful procedures
in this library.

Please see STATUS for a list of the files,
if they are needed, or not, written (in GDL or C++)
with perfect clone or less perfect

2/ Other files

some other files are put here, which are not in the IDL lib. path,
but correspond to procedures available in IDL, in binary (executable
build in) form. Here they are re-implemented in GDL langage.

e.g.:
save.pro
restore.pro
read_jpeg.pro
read_png.pro
write_jpeg.pro
write_png.pro
file_lines.pro
tvscl.pro
